We have tried various other instances and urls to get the contents from the original sites 
1st. Quora
we have found from the sources that we have 
![](https://github.com/Ayush-parkara-inventyv/obsidian_images/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020250513184450.png)
also we checked other ways like googling and privacy-guides
from all we got this github repo
![](https://github.com/Ayush-parkara-inventyv/obsidian_images/blob/main/Pasted%20image%2020250513184555.png)
and also we got the list of various instances

we tried all of these and most of them were showing 503 or 500 error
![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.45.06_06730899.jpg]]and ![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.45.54_3c37ac3f.jpg]]
but one was active and working and we were able to use it so we have added that to our code ![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.46.57_74e7f0e7.jpg]]
but also there is an issue in this that when we see the post or blog in quora we can see all the chats and messages but in this site we were able to see only one and not the others.

2nd.Twitter
for the twitter we did the same way searched both privacy-tools and guides as well as checked the github repo if we can find anything proper

here we saw that the nitter is working fine and we used it to redirect the urls to the nitter instance and it was working fine

3rd. Medium
In this we searched and got two common methods or instances that are working
https://scribe.rip/ -> **scribe**
and
**libmedium** -> https://libmedium.net
but what we found out that these instances are not providing full blogs of premium content![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.50.33_790f4b05.jpg]]
and the acutal post is this
![[Pasted image 20250513185302.png]]
and this ![[Pasted image 20250513185324.png]]
so we also tried libmedium but we got the same sort of responses
so for scribe to make it working we had to take help from the official github repo and run it locally using docker container
![[Pasted image 20250513185510.png]]

so instead we used https://archive.ph as an alternative
and it worked fine![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.53.51_fd664c4f.jpg]]
![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.57.42_8ac537cc.jpg]]
![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-13 at 18.58.02_890d58b6.jpg]]we can see that this worked fine so we kept archive.ph
4th.youtube
for youtube we got these 
![[Pasted image 20250513185857.png]]
so we decided to use freetube and it worked fine
